### Making FAIR soil data easier — together

FAIR data publication is a shared ambition in the soil science community.  
At the same time, we all know the reality: **making datasets truly Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable takes time, expertise, and effort from data providers**.

Metadata standards, variable descriptions, units, methods, vocabularies…  
All essential — and sometimes overwhelming.

**You are not alone in this.**

### Why this tool exists

Within the **Soilwise project**, we aim to **lower the effort required to annotate and document soil datasets**, without compromising scientific quality or FAIR principles.

This application is an **experimental data‑annotation tool** designed to:

- ✍️ Support data providers in describing their datasets clearly and consistently  
- 🧩 Help translate raw tables into **FAIR‑ready, reusable data assets**  
- 🚀 Reduce friction between data creation and data publication  
- 🤝 Encourage shared practices across the soil community

### What you can do here

With this tool, you can:

- Annotate variables in your dataset in a guided way  
- Reuse contextual information from documents or protocols  (we also hate to type the same thing twice)
- Improve clarity, consistency, and reusability of your data  
- Prepare your dataset for FAIR publication with **less manual effort**

This is an **experimental tool**: your feedback helps shape how we collectively improve data annotation workflows in Soilwise.

### 🌍 A community effort

FAIR data is not just a technical requirement — it is a **collective investment** in better science, transparency, and long‑term reuse.

Thank you for contributing your time, expertise, and data.  
Let’s make soil data more reusable — **step by step**.
